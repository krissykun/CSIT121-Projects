            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite things to do are play videogames and listen to music. The games I like most are RPGs and my absolute top 3 
                of all time are probably Dragon Age: Inquisition, Baldur's Gate 3 and Skyrim but Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2 are also amazing picks.
                Some of my favorite music artists are SOPHIE, Lexa, A.G. Cook, Duda Beat & Heavy Baile.
