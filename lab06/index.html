                <h3>CRAP Design Principles</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast - The page content is primarily black text over white backgrounds or white text over red backgrounds. Text is easy to read and sections are clearly separated with background colors, it's easy to see where images end and begin. However, Accessibility Checker says that users with low vision or colorblindness may struggle reading some parts.</li>

                        <li>Alignment - The content of pages is in the center of the viewport and properly spaced in sections. </li>
                        <li>Proximity - Articles, sections and links are properly grouped together with similar ones.</li>
                    </ul>
