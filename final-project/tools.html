                <p>
                    Here, I'll share some of the resources I found most helpful during the semester.
                    These include websites, tools, and fourms that I used to enhance my projects and learning experience.
                </p>
                <h3>Documentation & Tutorials</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a></dt>
                    <dd>One of the best sites with detailed information on every part of HTML and CSS. Lots of examples of things in use and in multiple ways.</dd>


                    <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN Web Docs</a></dt>
                    <dd>Another of the best sites for detailed information and it includes plenty of activities for practicing.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a></dt>
                    <dd>A lot of the web dev knowledge I had before this semester comes from this site. They have very detailed lessons to follow and interesting projects that cover every part of web dev (html, css, js, ruby, etc.).</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Forums & Chats</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">Stack Overflow</a></dt>
                    <dd>Essentially a more consistently professional version of reddit. The answers here are usually a lot more technical and detailed than Reddit's answers.</dd>

                    <dt><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></dt>
                    <dd>Reddit has plenty of subreddits with (some) useful people, lots of good answers to questions you might have. Sometimes I end a web search with "reddit" and get the perfect answer.</dd>

                    <dt><a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a></dt>
                    <dd>ChatGPT is helpful for plenty of things if you get stuck on something really specific, but more often it'll generate something terrible that you'll be inspired to change on your own.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>W3c Validation Services: <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">HTML</a>, <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS</a></dt>
                    <dd>W3c validators to check that your code is up to date and free of any major errors.</dd>

                    <dt><a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/">CSS Grid Generator</a></dt>
                    <dd>An interactive tool for creating grid layouts. It's very straightforward and works well.</dd>

                    <dt>Text: <a href="https://cooltext.com/">Cooltext</a> & <a href="https://www.dafont.com/top.php?page=1&l[]=1">Dafont</a></dt>
                    <dd>Two great resources for text/logo design. Cooltext is focused on more 2000s/blinkies style text logos and dafont is a collection of various fonts for normal text.</dd>

                    <dt>Website Color Design: <a href="http://colormind.io/bootstrap/">Colormind</a> & <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF">Paletton</a></dt>
                    <dd>Colormind and Paletton are both useful specifically for seeing how a color pallete works on a website. I prefer other sites for actually developing the color palettes.</dd>

                    <dt>Color Palettes: <a href="https://coolors.co/131200-78bc61-c0c781-c59b76-e9806e">Coolors</a> & <a href="https://colordesigner.io/">Color Designer</a></dt>
                    <dd>Both of these sites are really helpful for creating color palettes. Color designer also has really useful tools relating to the color palettes you make, like combining colors or adding colors between ones you have to make a gradient.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a></dt>
                    <dd>NeoCities is a free web hosting service that allows you to create and host your own website. It's one of a few good communities built around creating personal websites, especially ones in older 2000s styles.</dd>

                    <dt><a href="https://www.cursors-4u.com/">Cursors 4 U</a></dt>
                    <dd>A site with a large collection of free cursors, complete with code that can be copy-pasted into your own page.</dd>
