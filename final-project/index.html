                    Welcome to my final website for this semester! 
                    Here, you'll find the full set of labs I've done as well as some really helpful tools and resources.

                    This website is the culmination of everything I've learned about web development this semester.
                    I hope it's informative and interesting to look at.

                        This site is lightly inspired by the early 2000s web aesthetic, with a lot of bright colors and a very simple layout.
                        That's because I've been very into the early 2000s-2010s web aesthetic lately and I wanted this one to look more special, since it's the final project.
                        It mostly shows with the logo, background and some of the extra things I added like the cursor/trail and such.
                        Obviously, I didn't go as far as I would have liked to, since I didn't want to make it too hard to read or navigate
                        Then maybe if anyone saw it, they might want to make their own site like this on something like neocities.
