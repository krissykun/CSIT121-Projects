                    Welcome to my final website for this semester! 
                    Here, you'll find the full set of labs I've done as well as some really helpful tools and resources.

                    This website is the culmination of everything I've learned about web development this semester.
                    I hope it's informative and interesting to look at.

                        You might find that this site has a very nostialgic look, compared to my other more minimalistic labs.
                        That's because I've been very into the early 2000s-2010s web aesthetic lately and I wanted this one to look more special, since it's the final project.
                        Then maybe if anyone saw it, they might want to make their own site like this on neocities or spacehey.
