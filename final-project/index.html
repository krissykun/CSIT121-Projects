                    Welcome to my final website for this semester! 
                    Here, you'll find the full set of labs I've done as well as some really helpful tools and resources.

                    This website is the culmination of everything I've learned about web development this semester.
                    I hope it's informative and interesting to look at.

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Completing this final project was a great way to put everything I've learned this semester into practice all at once.
                    I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how to use them together to create a cohesive website.
                    The most challenging part was connecting the earlier labs to this one without breaking anything or just throwing links into a table.
                    Testing on different devices and browsers was frustrating at times, but it was a good way to learn the importance of responsive design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back on the semester as a whole, I've learned a lot more than I already knew about the building blocks of modern web design.
                    I did already know a lot of the basics, but gained so much more new and interesting knowledge about how to use them.
                    Thanks to this course, I have a better understanding of creating accessible and user-friendly websites.
                    This project especially helped me see how design and functionality can work together to create a great user experience.

                        This site is lightly inspired by the early 2000s web aesthetic, with a lot of bright colors and a very simple layout.
                        That's because I've been very into the early 2000s-2010s web aesthetic lately and I wanted this one to look more special, since it's the final project.
                        It mostly shows with the logo, background and some of the extra things I added like the cursor/trail and such.
                        Obviously, I didn't go as far as I would have liked to, since I didn't want to make it too hard to read or navigate
                        Then maybe if anyone saw it, they might want to make their own site like this on something like neocities.
