                <p>Over the course of these first 2 labs, we covered the basics of HTML and structuring our webpages. I was already familiar with HTML before completing assignments in this class, but it was enjoyable to refamiliarize myself with all the basics. In fact, I didn't remember some tags like the article or description list tags, so this was a really good refresher. Overall, it was enjoyable to make these first few basic pages.</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Basic HTML tags and attributes</li>

                    <li>How to format my code so that it's easily read</li>

                <p>During this lab, we learned a lot about the basics of using CSS to style our web pages. Even though I knew about CSS already, this was  a good refresher because I had never given it much thought before. The most valuable part of this lab, in my opinion, was covering the methods of applying CSS and the benefits of each. Overall, this was fun and gave me a chance to learn more CSS properties to use in my future web pages.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Structure of CSS rules</li>
                    <li>Different methods of applying CSS to HTML</li>
                    <li>Styling specific sections/elements with IDs and classes</li>
                </ol>
