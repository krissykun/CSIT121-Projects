                <p>Over the course of these first 2 labs, we covered the basics of HTML and structuring our webpages. I was already familiar with HTML before completing assignments in this class, but it was enjoyable to refamiliarize myself with all the basics. In fact, I didn't remember some tags like the article or description list tags, so this was a really good refresher. Overall, it was enjoyable to make these first few basic pages.</p>
