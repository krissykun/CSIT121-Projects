                    Have you wondered how your payments are processed when you shop online? 
                    Payment Method Identifiers (PMIs) play a crucial role in this process. 
                    Payment Method Identifiers (PMIs) help determine which payment methods are available for your transaction. 
                    They guide your browser in presenting compatible options like credit cards, digital wallets, or bank transfers. 
                    After you select a method, the browser interacts with the appropriate payment handler to process your payment securely.
                </p>

            <section>
                <p>PMIs are used inside the Payment Request API, which lets websites request payment from users in a secure and fast way. Developers use PMIs to tell the browser which payment methods they accept.</p>

                <p>Here are some examples of how it's used in code:</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Initiating a payment request</summary>
<!-- Unfortunately these code blocks have to look like this I think -->
<pre><code class="code-block">request.show().then((paymentResponse) => {
    // Here we would process the payment. For this demo, simulate immediate success:
    paymentResponse.complete("success").then(() => {
        // For demo purposes:
        introPanel.style.display = "none";
        successPanel.style.display = "block";
    });
});
</code></pre>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Pre-authorizing transactions</summary>
<pre><code class="code-block">const paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(
    [{ supportedMethods: "https://example.com/preauth" }],
    details,
);

// Send `CanMakePayment` event to the payment handler.
paymentRequest
    .canMakePayment()
    .then((res) => {
        if (res) {
        // The payment handler has pre-authorized a transaction
        // with some static amount, e.g., USD $1.00.
        } else {
        // Pre-authorization failed or payment handler not installed.
        }
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        // Unexpected error occurred.
    });
</code></pre>
