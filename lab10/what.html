                    Think of them as a sort of "fingerprint" for payment methods.
                    Just like a fingerprint is unique to each person, a PMI is unique to each payment method.

                    <p>
                        Payment Method Identifiers (PMIs) are unique identifiers used to represent different payment methods in a standardized way. 
                        They are used by payment processors, banks, and other financial institutions to ensure that payments are processed accurately and securely.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They can be found in two forms: URL-based PMIs or standardized PMIs. 
                        Each is covered in more detail below:
                    </p>

            <section> <!-- Deeper Explanation -->
                <h4>url-based PMIs</h4>
                    <p>
                        URL-based PMIs are formatted as a typical URL, which makes them easy to use in web apps and APIs.
                        For example, a URL-based PMI for a service like Apple Pay might look like this:
                        <code>https://apple.com/apple-pay</code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Steps for validating a url-based PMI:
                        <ol>
                            <li>If url's scheme is not "https", invalid</li>
                            <li>If url's username or password is not the empty string, invalid</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, valid</li>
                    </p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Examples: </summary>
                            <p>Valid:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>https://example.com/pay</code></li>
                                <li><code>https://example.com/pay/version/1</code></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Invalid:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>http://username:password@example</code>; uses http://, a username and a password</li>
                                <li><code>unknown://example.com/pay</code>; uses an unknown scheme</li>
                            </ul>
                    </details>

                <h4>Standardized PMIs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Standardized PMIs are in the form of a string . 
                        They are typically used in offline payment systems and are designed to be easily recognizable and understandable by both consumers and merchants.
                        Standardized PMIs are typically formatted as a string of characters, which makes them easy to use in offline applications and systems.
                        For example, a standardized PMI for a credit card payment method might look like this:
                        <code>credit-card</code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
