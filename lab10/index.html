                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <h3>What are web standards?</h3>
                <p>
                    Web standards are a set of guidelines and best practices for creating and maintaining web content. 
                    They ensure that web documents can be used, shared and developed across different platforms without issue. They also make it easier to keep pages accessible, to integrate different languages/technologies and future proof things. 
                    Some popular ones are HTML, XML, WCAG, and EPUB, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without these guidelines, the internet would be a much more chaotic and much less accessible place. 
                    They ensure that web documents can be used, shared and developed across different platforms without issue. 
                    Web developers and designers need to keep them in mind to keep the web safe and usable for all.
                </p>

                <h3>The purpose of this site:</h3>
                <p>
                    This site in particular intends to provide its readers (that's you!) with information on one specific web standard. 
                    In this case, that's Payment Method Identifiers (PMIs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    PMIs are used to identify payment methods in a standardized way. 
                    They're used by payment processors (think Stripe), banks, and other financial institutions to ensure payments are processed properly and safely.
                </p>
