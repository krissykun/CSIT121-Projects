                <p>I was already familiar with HTML before completing assignments in this class, but it was enjoyable to refamiliarize myself with all the basics. In fact, I didn't remember some tags like the article or description list tags, so this was a really good refresher.</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Basic HTML tags and attributes</li>
                    <li>How to upload my pages to Github</li>
                    <li>How to format my code so that it's easily read</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These resources were really helpful:</p>
